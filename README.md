# Resistance-Meter

I bought some circuit elements that included some resistors for university work. On my way home the resistors got unsorted. To make it easier to sort them, I made a simple Arduino project.

The circuit works with a simple voltage divider logic.

The voltage drop from the first resistor is inversely-proportional to the resistor connected serially to it. The voltage across the R resistor can be calculated with equation 1.

$\frac{R}{R+10^3}*5V= Vmeasured$                            (1) 

The equation 1 yields,

$\frac{10^3.Vmeasured}{5-Vmeasured}= R$                               (2)
                                             
Derived equation 2 is the logic behind the code thatâ€™s calculating the resistance.
